# Financial-Inclusion-Data

#Description
In this project, we will provide key insights into how individuals in Nigeria have access to financial products and services that satisfy individual requirements and explore key trends in the availability of economic opportunities in Nigeria. This project uses financial inclusion survey data from Nigeria to perform unsupervised machine learning using K-Means clustering. We aim to group individuals into clusters based on similar characteristics (age, mobile ownership, education, etc.) to understand different levels of financial inclusion.
