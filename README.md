# Financial-Inclusion-Data-Nigeria
This project explores the financial inclusion dataset for Nigeria to determine patterns based on various features (such as age, region, transactions, education level, among others). In addition, this project performs unsupervised machine learning on the dataset using K-Means Clustering. The project aims to group individuals into clusters based on their characteristics(age, region, education level).

# Project Objectives
* Use Python programming language to explore and uncover patterns within the dataset.
* Visualize patterns within the dataset using bar charts.
* Use K-means to group individuals into clusters based on various features.
* Visualize the clusters.
* Used Explainable AI(SHAP) to understand the features
